## Bio

Hey! I’m Jaypal, a data enthusiast who loves to play with data and deriving valuable insights out of it. I have a background in statistics, machine learning, and data visualization, and I enjoy digging into tough problems and finding hidden patterns.

Off data, I love to see the world, through the camera or just by travelling. I love photography, it lets me capture and remember all the beautiful places I go. When I’m not on the road or shooting pictures, you’ll mostly likely find me on the golf course - I love the game’s difficulty and its tranquillity.
