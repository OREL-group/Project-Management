# Introduction

*Irith Chaturvedi*

**I am Irith Chaturvedi**, a Senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Data Science + Information Science with minors in Computer Science and Statistics. With a 4.0 GPA, I am a James Scholar and Dean’s List recipient every semester.

My professional experiences span research, industry, hackathons, and non-profit work, allowing me to apply data-driven techniques across diverse domains while leading impactful projects.

### Research
As an Undergraduate Researcher in the Biodiversity Genomics Lab under Dr. Milton Tan, I contributed to a groundbreaking phylogenetic analysis of Cypriniformes. I addressed challenges of polyploidy and hybridization using targeted assembly and workflow automation with Nextflow. By developing a novel weighted scoring algorithm and leveraging Python parallelization and R statistical analysis, I reduced runtime by 60% and improved alignment accuracy by 94%.

### Industry
At COUNTRY Financial DigitaLab, I served as a Data Science and Project Management Intern within the Sales Compensation Agile Release Train. I built automated pipelines in PySpark, Hive, and Python, saving 140+ hours of manual QA per month. I also enhanced CI/CD pipelines with automated test frameworks and led a 4-member intern team to design an Agentic AI assistant that converts legacy HQL scripts into PySpark with automated PyTest generation.

### Hackathons
I led my team to 1st place at the COUNTRY Financial Hackathon 2025, creating GitMyWiki—an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI, and Streamlit to retrieve and summarize internal documentation. The solution is being pushed into production at COUNTRY.

### Non-Profit and Volunteer work
As an IT Intern at the 21st Century Dads Foundation, I developed a mobile app (1,000+ users), managed AWS and SQL databases, and performed grant research that secured $120,000 in funding. I also helped raise $80,000+ through fundraising events such as the Dads Honor Ride, supporting families of children with special needs.

### Leadership & Global Engagement
I serve as Head of Scholarship, Philanthropy, and Recruitment at Theta Xi Fraternity, where I organized a professional Speaker Series and implemented academic initiatives that raised the chapter GPA from 2.8 to 3.3. Beyond campus, I have traveled to 40+ countries, volunteered globally with Habitat for Humanity, and continue to pursue leadership through service and collaboration.
