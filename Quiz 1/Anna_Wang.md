create a document with at least three stylistic elements. Refer back to the online Markdown tutorial for these styles. For example, add headings and text elements in Markdown, an image with caption using HTML tags, and a table in .csv format. You may also use elements in .csv, LaTeX, Bookdown or other languages consistent with Github-flavored Markdown.
