If not, please [let me know](mailto:balicea@illinois.edu).

2) **assign yourself** to each issue and **label each issue** as appropriate. Create new labels as appropriate (see lecture notes on how to do this).  


3) from the [issues tab in the Github GUI](https://github.com/OREL-group/Project-Management/issues), create a standalone issue as shown in class. Give a title and description: for this issue, describe any potential rescoping of your Kanban board issues that may need to be done in the future.
